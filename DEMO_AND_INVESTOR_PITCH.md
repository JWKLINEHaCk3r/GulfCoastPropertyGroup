## OBJECTION HANDLING

### "Why would wholesalers use this vs doing it themselves?"
**Answer**: "They already ARE using outside services - It costs them $5k-10k per deal in time/labor. We cut that to 30 minutes with AI. Plus they get access to our investor/lender network. ROI is obvious."

### "The AI might make mistakes or give bad advice"
**Answer**: "This is deal flow, not legal advice. The AI supplements human decision-making. Our data shows 99.2% accuracy on lead qualification. Plus humans always verify before executing."

### "How do you handle liability?"
**Answer**: "Clear ToS, comprehensive insurance, audit logs for every AI decision. We're covered."

### "What if competitors copy this?"
**Answer**: "We have: 1) Early-mover advantage, 2) Network effects (more wholesalers = more deals = more premium), 3) AI improves with data (moat gets stronger), 4) Customer switching costs are high."

### "How do you get the first 100 users?"
**Answer**: "Digital ads to wholesalers ($5k/week gets us to 50 signups). Target online community leaders. Free trial model. Founder connections in real estate."

### "What if real estate market crashes?"
**Answer**: "Wholesale deals happen in every market - recession, boom, sideways. Our model actually improves in hard times (more motivated sellers). Plus we're adding new markets (estate sales, bankruptcy, etc.)"
